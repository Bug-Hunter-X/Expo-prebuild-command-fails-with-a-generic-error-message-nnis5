This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, especially when dealing with native modules or complex project setups.  The underlying issue often stems from problems with native dependencies, incorrect configurations in your `app.json` or `package.json`, or issues with the Android or iOS build systems themselves.  The error message itself is quite general and doesn't always pinpoint the precise cause.
