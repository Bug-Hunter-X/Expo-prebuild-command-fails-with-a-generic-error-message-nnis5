The solution requires a systematic approach to debugging, involving multiple potential checks:

1. **Check `package.json`:**  Carefully review your `package.json` file for conflicting or incompatible dependencies, especially native modules.  Ensure all versions are compatible with each other and with your Expo SDK version.

2. **Verify native modules:** If using native modules, ensure they are correctly installed and configured.  Follow the instructions provided in the module's documentation.

3. **Review `app.json`:**  Check for any configuration errors in your `app.json` file, especially settings related to Android or iOS.  Incorrectly configured settings might interfere with the build process.

4. **Clean build cache:**  Sometimes, cached files can cause unexpected errors.  Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the build cache and force a fresh build. 

5. **Examine iOS/Android build logs:**  If the above steps fail, look at the detailed build logs produced for iOS and Android. These logs often contain more specific error messages than the general `expo prebuild` error.  To access them, usually need to check the respective folders generated during the build.

6. **Inspect Android build environment:** On Android, ensure the Android SDK and necessary build tools are properly installed and configured.  Check the environment variables for correctness. 

7. **Simplify the Project (Isolation):** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem. If possible, create a new expo project from scratch, incrementally adding components from your problematic project until the issue is reproduced. This helps identify the problematic component or dependency.

```javascript
// Example of a simplified project to test
expo init minimalProject
cd minimalProject
npm install expo prebuild
expo prebuild // try to run prebuild on this simplified project 
```
